User stories

 - User should be able to add a new item to the list in input field which will appear in the to do list component
 - User should be able to "complete" to do list item by checking box which will delete it from the store
 - If user tries to add an item that already exists on list it should render an error message that says "this item already exists" or something like that

 All state should utilize redux state management (no raising of state to App component level)
